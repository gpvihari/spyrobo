Spy Robo with gesture controls

#Author: Prashant Vihari G

#Description
In many applications of controlling robotic gadget, it becomes quite hard and complicated when there comes the part of controlling it with remote. Usage is in military, archealogists, Astronouts and raw/spy agents.

A new concept is introduced to control the machine with moment of hand. Just need to wear a small transmitting device on your hand which included an accelaration meter. It transmits an approporiate command to robot so that it can do whatever you want.
